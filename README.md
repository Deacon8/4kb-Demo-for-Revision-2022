# Revision22

This was an attempt to create a 4kb demoscene for Revision 2022, as it was online due to Covid, so I didn't have to fly out to Germany.

To save space, I attempted to use a single compute shader, rather than a vertex and fragment. I attached the result to a framebuffer and blitted it to the screen.

So it worked on my PC, but it didn't on the demo PC. I'm thinking since I have integrated Intel Graphics, it somehow wasn't compatible, but really there isn't really a good way to figure it out.

The Demoscene was raymarched 3D cellular automata with a flying camera, and some music, using 4klang

I had a lot of problems with trying to use 4klang so I was only able to play one note at once. The audio was pretty bad. \
It not running may have been a blessing in disguise.
